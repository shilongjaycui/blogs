## [Philosophies](https://medium.com/illumination-curated/i-made-over-500-000-by-writing-on-the-internet-here-are-50-lessons-i-wish-i-had-learned-sooner-3d158dd8bf63)
- Be mindful of anything I read:
  - Why did I click on a headline?
  - Why did I (dis)like a sentence?
- Be consistent: Lots of reps!
- Growing my audience is about emotions and stories just as much as it is about value. I can "create value" within seconds by using tools like ChatGPT. But I can't replicate human connection, emotions, and personal stories.
  - Every sentence I write needs to get my reader excited about the following sentence.
  - Being vulnerable and honest is the most effective way to connect with my readers.
- Don't publish my writing without reading it out loud.
- My bio/profile should tell my readers what I can do for them. Remove irrelevant credentials and tell them why they should pay attention to my work.
